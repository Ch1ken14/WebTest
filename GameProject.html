                    <p>
                        Bonkers is a multiplayer "SmashBro-Like" game with a mix of Apple Picker.
                        Players will have to compete with each other to get the most amount of coins while 
                        trying to knock the other player of the stage. I made this project during my 3rd Year in college.
                        This was my first ever game where I spent a lot of time with the asset, giving it a sketch like or doodle like look.

                    <h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>
                       Two players spawn in a arena where they have to collect the most amount of coins in a certain amount of time. 
                       The player with the most amount of coins after the timer end wins.
                    </p>

                    <p>Players can move left, right, up, down, and dash. When a player dashes and hits the other player, the other player gets knock back
                        and will lose 2 coins if they did have coins collected. Players can pick up a power up that speeds up their movement which can help it maneuvering 
                        around the stage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tip: If you get knock back and is off the stage but have your dash, you can dash back in to the stage to avoid falling and losing your coins.

                        <h3>What I learned</h3>
                            <p>
                        I learned a lot during the process of making this game. One of the things I learned is how to make 
                         fun assets. For me the art style of this game is what really stands out for me because it reminds me 
                        of my old elementary days where I use to doodle a lot and it really reflect here in the art style of the game.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            The other thing a learned is how to implement a knock back mechanic in a 2D game. I had fun watching and reading
                            things about how to do knock back effect in unity. It thought me a lot more about how the rigidbody2d component works in 
                            unity.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            I also learned how to make a simple game more interesting and unique by thinking outside the box. The is basically a combination of an apple picker game and 
                            brawler game. I was thinking about how to make an apple picker, a simple game more fun and engaging and I thought how fun would it be
                            if you have to fight for you to get the apple and that is basically how I came up with the gameplay of the game.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            Although I've stop working on this project, there are still things I want to do to complete it. The game still lacks visual impacts to better tell the player if they hit the other player with their knockback.
                            The gameplay for me feels incomplete and is very stiff. Lack of gameplay variety with the power ups you can get which there is only one power up. However, I'm still happy 
                            with how this game turned out because I learned a lot while developing this game and maybe someday I'll revisit this game and finish it.
