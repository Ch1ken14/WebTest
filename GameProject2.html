                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unadorned Tower Defense is a simple tower defense game set in a medieval era. The player
                        must protect the kingdom from an endless horde of the undead by building towers, upgrading,
                        and collecting resources. I made this game during my 2nd Year in college. This was my first 
                        ever 3D game.

                    <p>
                       Protect the kingdom from invading hordes! In this medieval 
                       tower defense game, build and upgrade archer towers, cannons, and knight barracks along enemy paths. Use gold 
                       earned from fallen foes to strengthen your defenses and 
                       upgrade your towers. Face endless waves of undead knights as you defend castles, villages, and ancient 
                       ruins with strategic tower placement and resource management.
                    </p>

                    <p>Players can click the green highlighted slabs to build a tower. Clicking a tower allows you to you
                        demolish or upgrade it. Killing foes gives you gold which you can use to build or upgrade towers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tip: Try building new towers instead of upgrading one tower immediately, you do more Damage Per Second(DPS) when doing this.

                        <h3>What I learned</h3>
                            <p>
                            This was my first game where I really understood how to use the unity engine. I learned a lot about how it works and 
                            the tools available with it. I am so thankful that I had the best professor as our subject teacher for that class because
                            I learned a lot about programming because of him. This also opened my eyes that math plays a big role in developing cool and 
                            fun games.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            I was introduce to 3D modeling when making this game because we were required to make our own 3D assets for the towers and enemies.
                            I learn the basic of blender while doing this project, however, I had a hard time adding animation to the models I made and literally 
                            found a solution to the issue the night before the final presentation for this project. I had to the an all-nighter because of it.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            I also learned about game optimization and how object rendering works. Our professor introduce the concept of object pooling 
                            and taught us how and why game optimization matters in making games. 
                         </p>
                         
                         <p>
                            It was this part of my college year where I decided to commit to game development because before I was having doubts whether this was worth it.
                            However, after doing this project and having a professor who finally knew game development, it made me think that maybe this is worth going for.
