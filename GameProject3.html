                    <p>
                        Blossoming Memories is a Narrative Driven Simulation game. 
                        The player plays the character of a florist selling flowers to an unfamilliar neighborhood.
                        Through out her journey, she will meet a variety of characters that helps her understand more about herself and 
                        about flowers. This was during my 3rd Year in college and it was my first ever collaborative work.

                        <h3>What I learned</h3>
                            <p>
                            This was my first game where I work with other people. This taught me how to cooperate with other people in making games and made me realize something about myself.
                            It was fun having to brain storm with other people about making games, thinking about its mechanics, and how the game should look.
                            Listening to other people's perspective really is so refreshing and exciting because you learn new things from it.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            During the development of this game, I was having time management issues and it make me think about how I should approach future projects.
                            I was also procastinating telling myself that I can finish the things that needs to be done in a day when in reality I can't and paid for my action with 
                            an all-nighter.
                
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            I challenged myself to not look at any tutorials and that I should do all the coding myself. It was so much fun and exciting thinking about how I should approach creating my own code. 
                             Although they were ineffecient and stupid, I was still proud of it because I did it all myself without any help and made me realize that there is so 
                            much more room for me to grow and that excites me.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            This experience taught how to be a better programmer and to always strive for knowledge. We should not limit ourselves and always try new things. Collaborate with 
                            other people and learn from the perspective of others. Be happy with any progress you make either big or small because any progress is still progress and eventually 
                            you can finally tell yourself that you've made it.
                         </p>
